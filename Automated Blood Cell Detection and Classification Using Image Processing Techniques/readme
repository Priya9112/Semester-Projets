The project deals with the preprocessing and enhancement of medical images using filters such as Gaussian, Median, and more to enhance their clarity. 
Features extracted include edge count, variance, and intensity, and the best filter for enhancement is predicted by a Random Forest Classifier. 
The processed images are then later enhanced with Sobel, Canny edge detection, and morphological filters (erosion and dilation) to accurately identify and annotate RBCs and WBCs using bounding boxes. 
Labeled datasets are then used to determine the precise cell counting and classification results of accurate analysis visually presented for good medical analysis.
